Servo control via GPIO: I tried manually controlling the servo but experienced some jitters because it is difficult to get pulse width modulation correct. I'm using ServoBlaster which provides an interface to drive the sero via the GPIO pins. The projet is located here: https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster
